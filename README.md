## Main idea
Helps students to calculate average mark based on exam passing and indicate whether they have the scholarship for next semester or not. Designed to work for [Lviv Polytechnic National University](https://www.google.com.ua/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjT74zY58XOAhWBLcAKHe0cDnwQFggbMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lp.edu.ua%2Fen&usg=AFQjCNFO9j44xI9fDnWe9P8NSUqHia3ikg&sig2=bHGq85mm4xDf064fjEURZg&bvm=bv.129759880,d.ZGg).


## Why?
This project was created for learning purpose in late-2012. Originally it was designed to work with Android 17 API and Eclipse. At mid of 2016 I have moved the project into  "AndroidStudio" and "Git". Of course this code have **bad smell)))** but since it's my first project I'm kind of proud that it works just fine with the first attempt after few years passed and migration to Android Studio.
